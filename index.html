    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="strike">CSS is not neccessary.</span><span class="yellowbg" >CSS saves a lot of work</span> can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="para">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3 class="heading">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="">Inline - by using the style attribute inside  HTML elements1</span></li>
        <li><span class="">Internal - by using a style element in the head section</span></li>
        <li><span class="" >External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</span></li>
        <li><span class="">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="yellowbg">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>,because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier
            for you to try it yourself</span></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
 
<p class="heading">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
<br>
<p  class="heading">In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
